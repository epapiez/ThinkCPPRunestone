Stack diagrams for recursive functions
--------------------------------------

In the previous chapter we used a stack diagram to represent the state
of a program during a function call. The same kind of diagram can make
it easier to interpret a recursive function.

Remember that every time a function gets called it creates a new
instance that contains the functionâ€™s local variables and parameters.

This figure shows a stack diagram for countdown, called with n = 3:





There is one instance of main and four instances of countdown, each with
a different value for the parameter n. The bottom of the stack,
countdown with n=0 is the base case. It does not make a recursive call,
so there are no more instances of countdown.

The instance of main is empty because main does not have any parameters
or local variables. As an exercise, draw a stack diagram for nLines,
invoked with the parameter n=4.
