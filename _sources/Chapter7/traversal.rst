Traversal
---------

A common thing to do with a string is start at the beginning, select
each character in turn, do something to it, and continue until the end.
This pattern of processing is called a **traversal**. A natural way to
encode a traversal is with a ``while`` statement:

.. activecode:: seventhree_
  :language: cpp
  :caption: Accessing a string character

     #include <string>
     #include <iostream>
     using namespace std;

     int main() {

      int index = 0;

      string fruit = "apple";

      int lengthfruit = fruit.length();

      while (index < lengthfruit) {
        char letter = fruit[index];
        cout << letter << endl;
        index = index + 1;
        }
    }

This loop traverses the string and outputs each letter on a line by
itself. Notice that the condition is ``index < lengthfruit``, which
means that when ``index`` is equal to the length of the string, the
condition is false and the body of the loop is not executed. The last
character we access is the one with the index ``fruit.length()-1``.

The name of the loop variable is ``index``. An **index** is a variable
or value used to specify one member of an ordered set, in this case the
set of characters in the string. The index indicates (hence the name)
which one you want. The set has to be ordered so that each letter has an
index and each index refers to a single character.

As an exercise, write a function that takes an ``string`` as an argument
and that outputs the letters backwards, all on one line.

Feel free to use the space below to test out your function.

.. activecode:: seventhree_one
  :language: cpp
  :caption: Feel free to use this space to test out your function.

     #include <iostream>
     using namespace std;

     void reverseWord(string word) {

     }

     int main() {
        reverseWord("hello");
      }



.. mchoice:: test_question_seven_four
   :practice: T
   :answer_a: 0
   :answer_b: 1
   :answer_c: 2
   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: Incorrect, idx goes through the odd numbers starting at 1.
   :feedback_b: Yes, idx goes through the odd numbers starting at 1.  o is at position 1 and 8.
   :feedback_c: There are 2 o characters but idx does not take on the correct index values for both.


   How many times is the letter o printed by the following statements?

   .. code-block:: cpp

      string s = "coding rocks";
      int idx = 1;
      int length = s.length();
      while (idx < length) {
        cout << s[idx] << endl;
        idx = idx + 2;
      }
