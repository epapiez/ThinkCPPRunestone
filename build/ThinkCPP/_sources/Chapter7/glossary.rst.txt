Glossary
--------

object:
   A collection of related data that comes with a set of functions that
   operate on it. The objects we have used so far are the ``cout``
   object provided by the system, and ``string``\ s.

index:
   A variable or value used to select one of the members of an ordered
   set, like a character from a string.

traverse:
   To iterate through all the elements of a set performing a similar
   operation on each.

counter:
   A variable used to count something, usually initialized to zero and
   then incremented.

increment:
   Increase the value of a variable by one. The increment operator in
   C++ is ``++``. In fact, that’s why C++ is called C++, because it is
   meant to be one better than C.

decrement:
   Decrease the value of a variable by one. The decrement operator in
   C++ is ``–``.

concatenate:
   To join two operands end-to-end.

   You might be wondering what I mean by **class**.It will be a few more
   chapters before I can give a complete definition, but for now a class
   is a collection of functions that defines the operations we can
   perform on some type. The ``string`` class contains all the functions
   that apply to ``string``\ \ s.
