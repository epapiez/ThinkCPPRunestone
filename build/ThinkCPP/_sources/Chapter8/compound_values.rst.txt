Compound values
---------------

Most of the data types we have been working with represent a single
value—an integer, a floating-point number, a boolean value.
``string``\ s are different in the sense that they are made up of
smaller pieces, the characters. Thus, ``string``\ s are an example of a
**compound** type.

Depending on what we are doing, we may want to treat a compound type as
a single thing (or object), or we may want to access its parts (or
instance variables). This ambiguity is useful.

It is also useful to be able to create your own compound values. C++
provides two mechanisms for doing that: **structures** and **classes**.
We will start out with structures and get to classes in
Chapter `[class] <#class>`__ (there is not much difference between
them).
